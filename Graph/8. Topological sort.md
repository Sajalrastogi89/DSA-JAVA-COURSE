# Topological Sorting

## Overview

Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `uv` from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering. It helps in scheduling tasks, resolving dependencies, and analyzing sequences of events.

### Key Concepts

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using adjacency lists or matrices.
   - It contains directed edges without cycles (DAG).

2. **Kahn's Algorithm**:
   - Kahn's algorithm is a popular method to perform topological sorting of a DAG.
   - It uses a queue to manage vertices with zero incoming edges and processes vertices in a sequence ensuring all dependencies are satisfied.

3. **Applications**:
   - **Task Scheduling**: Determines the order of tasks based on their dependencies.
   - **Compiler Design**: Determines the order of code execution in compilers.
   - **Dependency Resolution**: Resolves dependencies in software and data processing pipelines.

### Steps for Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algorithm)

1. **Initialization**:
   - Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
   - Initialize a queue with vertices having zero in-degree.

2. **Processing**:
   - Repeat until the queue is empty:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue (represents next in topological order).
     - Decrease in-degree of adjacent vertices.
     - If in-degree of an adjacent vertex becomes zero, add it to the queue.

3. **Completion**:
   - If the queue is empty and all vertices are processed, a topological sort order is found.
   - If not all vertices are processed (graph has cycles), topological sorting is not possible.

### Java Implementation Example: Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algorithm)

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm for a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TopologicalSort {

    // Graph class with adjacency list representation
    static class Graph {
        private int vertices;
        private List<List<Integer>> adjList;

        // Constructor to initialize the graph
        Graph(int vertices) {
            this.vertices = vertices;
            adjList = new ArrayList<>(vertices);
            for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
                adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
            }
        }

        // Method to add a directed edge from u to v
        void addEdge(int u, int v) {
            adjList.get(u).add(v);
        }

        // Method to perform topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
        List<Integer> topologicalSort() {
            List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
            int[] inDegree = new int[vertices];

            // Compute in-degree for each vertex
            for (int u = 0; u < vertices; u++) {
                for (int v : adjList.get(u)) {
                    inDegree[v]++;
                }
            }

            // Queue to store vertices with zero in-degree
            Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            for (int u = 0; u < vertices; u++) {
                if (inDegree[u] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(u);
                }
            }

            // Process vertices in topological order
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                int u = queue.poll();
                result.add(u);

                // Decrease in-degree of adjacent vertices
                for (int v : adjList.get(u)) {
                    inDegree[v]--;
                    if (inDegree[v] == 0) {
                        queue.offer(v);
                    }
                }
            }

            // Check if all vertices are included in the result
            if (result.size() != vertices) {
                System.out.println("Graph has cycles! Topological sorting not possible.");
                return new ArrayList<>();
            }

            return result;
        }
    }

    // Main method to test topological sorting
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int vertices = 6;
        Graph graph = new Graph(vertices);

        // Example graph with directed edges
        graph.addEdge(5, 2);
        graph.addEdge(5, 0);
        graph.addEdge(4, 0);
        graph.addEdge(4, 1);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 1);

        List<Integer> topologicalOrder = graph.topologicalSort();
        System.out.println("Topological Sort Order:");
        System.out.println(topologicalOrder);
    }
}
