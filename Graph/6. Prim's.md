# Prim's Algorithm

## Overview

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted, connected graph. It starts from an arbitrary vertex and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex from the MST to a vertex not yet in the MST.

### Key Concepts

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using adjacency lists or matrices.
   - Each edge has a weight representing the cost to connect two vertices.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Prim's algorithm grows the MST one vertex at a time.
   - It always adds the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.

3. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**:
   - Prim's algorithm uses a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the minimum weight edge.
   - This ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently even for large graphs.

### Steps for Prim's Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start from an arbitrary vertex (usually vertex 0) and add it to the MST.
   - Initialize a priority queue to manage edges with their weights.

2. **Growing the MST**:
   - Repeat until all vertices are included in the MST:
     - Extract the minimum weight edge from the priority queue.
     - If the edge connects a vertex outside the MST to a vertex in the MST, add it to the MST and update the priority queue with new edges.

3. **Completion**:
   - Once all vertices are included in the MST, the algorithm terminates.

### Java Implementation Example: Prim's Algorithm

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted, connected graph:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PrimsAlgorithm {

    // Graph class with adjacency list representation
    static class Graph {
        private int vertices;
        private List<List<Edge>> adjList;

        // Edge class to represent weighted edges
        static class Edge {
            int destination;
            int weight;

            Edge(int destination, int weight) {
                this.destination = destination;
                this.weight = weight;
            }
        }

        // Constructor to initialize the graph
        Graph(int vertices) {
            this.vertices = vertices;
            adjList = new ArrayList<>(vertices);
            for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
                adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
            }
        }

        // Method to add an edge between vertices
        void addEdge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
            adjList.get(source).add(new Edge(destination, weight));
            adjList.get(destination).add(new Edge(source, weight)); // Uncomment for undirected graph
        }

        // Method to find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm
        void primMST() {
            boolean[] inMST = new boolean[vertices];
            PriorityQueue<Edge> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.weight));
            int minCost = 0;

            // Start from vertex 0
            pq.offer(new Edge(0, 0));

            while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                Edge edge = pq.poll();
                int u = edge.destination;

                // Skip if already in MST
                if (inMST[u]) continue;

                // Include vertex u in MST
                inMST[u] = true;
                minCost += edge.weight;

                // Add all adjacent edges of u to priority queue
                for (Edge adjEdge : adjList.get(u)) {
                    if (!inMST[adjEdge.destination]) {
                        pq.offer(adjEdge);
                    }
                }
            }

            // Print minimum cost of MST
            System.out.println("Minimum Cost of MST: " + minCost);
        }
    }

    // Main method to test Prim's algorithm
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int vertices = 5;
        Graph graph = new Graph(vertices);

        // Example graph with weighted edges
        graph.addEdge(0, 1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(0, 3, 6);
        graph.addEdge(1, 2, 3);
        graph.addEdge(1, 3, 8);
        graph.addEdge(1, 4, 5);
        graph.addEdge(2, 4, 7);
        graph.addEdge(3, 4, 9);

        graph.primMST();
    }
}
