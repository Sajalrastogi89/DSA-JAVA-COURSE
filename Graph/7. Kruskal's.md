# Kruskal's Algorithm

## Overview

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted, connected graph. Unlike Prim's algorithm, which grows the MST from a starting vertex, Kruskal's algorithm processes edges in ascending order of weight and adds edges to the MST if they do not form a cycle.

### Key Concepts

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using edges with weights.
   - Edges are sorted by weight to ensure the algorithm adds the smallest edge that connects two components.

2. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Kruskal's algorithm uses a union-find (disjoint-set) data structure to efficiently manage and merge sets of vertices.
   - It ensures that adding an edge does not form a cycle in the MST.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The algorithm iterates over edges in increasing order of weight.
   - It adds an edge to the MST if it connects two different components (sets of vertices).

### Steps for Kruskal's Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a priority queue or sort edges by weight.
   - Initialize a union-find data structure to manage sets of vertices.

2. **Processing Edges**:
   - Iterate through sorted edges:
     - For each edge, check if it connects two different components using the union-find data structure.
     - If so, add the edge to the MST and merge the components.

3. **Completion**:
   - Stop when the MST contains `V-1` edges (where `V` is the number of vertices).

### Java Implementation Example: Kruskal's Algorithm

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted, connected graph:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class KruskalsAlgorithm {

    // Graph class with edge representation
    static class Graph {
        private int vertices, edges;
        private List<Edge> edgeList;

        // Edge class to represent weighted edges
        static class Edge {
            int source, destination, weight;

            Edge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
                this.source = source;
                this.destination = destination;
                this.weight = weight;
            }
        }

        // Constructor to initialize the graph
        Graph(int vertices, int edges) {
            this.vertices = vertices;
            this.edges = edges;
            edgeList = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Method to add an edge to the graph
        void addEdge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
            edgeList.add(new Edge(source, destination, weight));
        }

        // Helper function to find the root of a vertex
        int find(int[] parent, int vertex) {
            if (parent[vertex] == -1) {
                return vertex;
            }
            return find(parent, parent[vertex]);
        }

        // Helper function to union two sets of vertices
        void union(int[] parent, int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(parent, x);
            int rootY = find(parent, y);
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }

        // Method to apply Kruskal's algorithm to find MST
        void kruskalMST() {
            List<Edge> mst = new ArrayList<>();
            int[] parent = new int[vertices];
            Arrays.fill(parent, -1);

            // Sort edges by weight
            edgeList.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.weight));

            int edgeCount = 0;
            int index = 0;

            while (edgeCount < vertices - 1 && index < edges) {
                Edge edge = edgeList.get(index++);
                int rootSource = find(parent, edge.source);
                int rootDestination = find(parent, edge.destination);

                // Check if including this edge does not form a cycle
                if (rootSource != rootDestination) {
                    mst.add(edge);
                    union(parent, rootSource, rootDestination);
                    edgeCount++;
                }
            }

            // Print MST edges and total weight
            System.out.println("Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Edges:");
            for (Edge edge : mst) {
                System.out.println(edge.source + " - " + edge.destination + ": " + edge.weight);
            }
        }
    }

    // Main method to test Kruskal's algorithm
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int vertices = 4;
        int edges = 5;
        Graph graph = new Graph(vertices, edges);

        // Example graph with weighted edges
        graph.addEdge(0, 1, 10);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2, 6);
        graph.addEdge(0, 3, 5);
        graph.addEdge(1, 3, 15);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3, 4);

        graph.kruskalMST();
    }
}
