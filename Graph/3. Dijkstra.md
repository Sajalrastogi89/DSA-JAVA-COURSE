# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview

Dijkstra's algorithm is a famous algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It is efficient and guarantees the shortest path if all edge weights are non-negative.

### Key Concepts

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using adjacency lists or matrices.
   - Each edge has a non-negative weight representing the cost to traverse it.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the vertex with the smallest known distance.
   - This ensures efficient retrieval and update of vertex distances during traversal.

3. **Single-Source Shortest Path**:
   - It calculates the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

### Steps for Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.
   - Use a priority queue to manage vertices based on their current shortest distance.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Extract the vertex with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
   - Update distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found via this vertex.

3. **Completion**:
   - Continue until all vertices are processed, ensuring the shortest path distances are finalized.

### Java Implementation Example: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DijkstraAlgorithm {

    // Graph class with adjacency list representation
    static class Graph {
        private int vertices;
        private List<List<Edge>> adjList;

        // Edge class to represent weighted edges
        static class Edge {
            int destination;
            int weight;

            Edge(int destination, int weight) {
                this.destination = destination;
                this.weight = weight;
            }
        }

        // Constructor to initialize the graph
        Graph(int vertices) {
            this.vertices = vertices;
            adjList = new ArrayList<>(vertices);
            for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
                adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
            }
        }

        // Method to add an edge between vertices
        void addEdge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
            adjList.get(source).add(new Edge(destination, weight));
            // Uncomment below for undirected graph
            // adjList.get(destination).add(new Edge(source, weight));
        }

        // Method to find shortest paths from a source vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm
        void dijkstra(int source) {
            // Initialize distances array with infinity
            int[] distances = new int[vertices];
            Arrays.fill(distances, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            distances[source] = 0;

            // Priority queue (min-heap) to store vertices based on minimum distance
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(v -> distances[v]));
            pq.offer(source);

            while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                int current = pq.poll();

                // Explore neighbors of the current vertex
                for (Edge edge : adjList.get(current)) {
                    int newDistance = distances[current] + edge.weight;
                    if (newDistance < distances[edge.destination]) {
                        distances[edge.destination] = newDistance;
                        pq.offer(edge.destination);
                    }
                }
            }

            // Print shortest distances from source vertex to all other vertices
            System.out.println("Shortest distances from vertex " + source + ":");
            for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
                System.out.println("Vertex " + i + ": " + distances[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Main method to test Dijkstra's algorithm
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int vertices = 5;
        Graph graph = new Graph(vertices);

        // Example graph with weighted edges
        graph.addEdge(0, 1, 4);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2, 1);
        graph.addEdge(1, 3, 1);
        graph.addEdge(2, 1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3, 5);
        graph.addEdge(3, 4, 3);

        int sourceVertex = 0;
        graph.dijkstra(sourceVertex);
    }
}
