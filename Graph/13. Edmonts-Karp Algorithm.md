# Edmonds-Karp Algorithm for Maximum Flow

## Overview

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths and is particularly efficient for networks with small integer capacities.

### Key Concepts

1. **Flow Network**:
   - A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity indicating the maximum flow that can pass through it.

2. **Maximum Flow**:
   - Maximum flow in a flow network is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source vertex to a sink vertex.

3. **Residual Graph**:
   - The residual graph of a flow network shows available capacity for flow after a certain amount of flow has been sent.

### Algorithm Steps

#### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize flow on all edges to 0.
   - Construct the residual graph with capacities and flows.

2. **BFS for Augmenting Paths**:
   - Use BFS to find the shortest augmenting path from the source to the sink in the residual graph.
   - Augment flow along this path by the minimum residual capacity of the edges in the path.

3. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat step 2 until no more augmenting paths can be found.

4. **Output**:
   - The maximum flow is the sum of flows into the sink from all sources.

### Java Implementation Example

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating the Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding maximum flow in a flow network:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class EdmondsKarp {

    static final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    // Method to find maximum flow in a flow network using Edmonds-Karp algorithm
    int edmondsKarp(int[][] capacity, int source, int sink) {
        int[][] residualCapacity = new int[capacity.length][capacity.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < capacity.length; i++) {
            System.arraycopy(capacity[i], 0, residualCapacity[i], 0, capacity.length);
        }

        int[] parent = new int[capacity.length];
        int maxFlow = 0;

        while (true) {
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[capacity.length];
            Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            queue.add(source);
            visited[source] = true;
            parent[source] = -1;

            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                int u = queue.poll();

                for (int v = 0; v < capacity.length; v++) {
                    if (!visited[v] && residualCapacity[u][v] > 0) {
                        queue.add(v);
                        visited[v] = true;
                        parent[v] = u;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (!visited[sink]) {
                break;
            }

            int pathFlow = INF;
            for (int v = sink; v != source; v = parent[v]) {
                int u = parent[v];
                pathFlow = Math.min(pathFlow, residualCapacity[u][v]);
            }

            for (int v = sink; v != source; v = parent[v]) {
                int u = parent[v];
                residualCapacity[u][v] -= pathFlow;
                residualCapacity[v][u] += pathFlow;
            }

            maxFlow += pathFlow;
        }

        return maxFlow;
    }

    // Main method to test the Edmonds-Karp algorithm
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] capacity = {
                {0, 16, 13, 0, 0, 0},
                {0, 0, 10, 12, 0, 0},
                {0, 4, 0, 0, 14, 0},
                {0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 20},
                {0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 4},
                {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
        };
        int source = 0, sink = 5;
        EdmondsKarp ek = new EdmondsKarp();
        int maxFlow = ek.edmondsKarp(capacity, source, sink);
        System.out.println("Maximum Flow from source to sink: " + maxFlow);
    }
}
