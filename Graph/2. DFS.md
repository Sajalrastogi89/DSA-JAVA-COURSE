# Depth-First Search (DFS) in Graphs

## Overview

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's useful for tasks like detecting cycles in graphs, pathfinding in mazes, and topological sorting.

### Key Concepts

1. **Graph Traversal**:
   - DFS explores nodes depth-wise, going as far as possible from the starting vertex before backtracking.
   - It uses a stack (or recursion) to manage the order of exploration.

2. **Stack Usage**:
   - DFS uses a stack to maintain the order of exploration, ensuring nodes are processed in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.

3. **Applications**:
   - **Cycle Detection**: Identify cycles in directed or undirected graphs.
   - **Pathfinding**: Find paths between nodes in mazes or maps.
   - **Topological Sorting**: Order vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### Steps for DFS Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start from a chosen source node and mark it as visited.
   - Use a stack (or recursion) to manage nodes to explore.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Visit the current node, mark it as visited, and push it onto the stack (or use recursion for function call stack).
   - Explore each unvisited neighbor recursively until no more unvisited neighbors are left.

3. **Completion**:
   - Continue until all reachable nodes are visited, ensuring all connected components are explored.

### Java Implementation Example: DFS Traversal

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating DFS traversal in a graph represented using adjacency lists:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DFSGraphTraversal {

    // Graph class with adjacency list representation
    static class Graph {
        private int vertices;
        private LinkedList<Integer>[] adjList;

        // Constructor to initialize the graph
        Graph(int vertices) {
            this.vertices = vertices;
            adjList = new LinkedList[vertices];
            for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
                adjList[i] = new LinkedList<>();
            }
        }

        // Method to add an edge between vertices
        void addEdge(int source, int destination) {
            adjList[source].add(destination);
            // Uncomment below for undirected graph
            // adjList[destination].add(source);
        }

        // Method to perform DFS traversal from a given source vertex
        void DFS(int source) {
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
            Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

            visited[source] = true;
            stack.push(source);

            while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                int current = stack.pop();
                System.out.print(current + " ");

                for (int neighbor : adjList[current]) {
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        visited[neighbor] = true;
                        stack.push(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Main method to test DFS traversal
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int vertices = 6;
        Graph graph = new Graph(vertices);

        // Example graph
        graph.addEdge(0, 1);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2);
        graph.addEdge(1, 3);
        graph.addEdge(1, 4);
        graph.addEdge(2, 4);
        graph.addEdge(3, 5);
        graph.addEdge(4, 5);

        System.out.println("DFS traversal starting from vertex 0:");
        graph.DFS(0);
        // Output: DFS traversal starting from vertex 0: 0 2 4 5 1 3
    }
}
