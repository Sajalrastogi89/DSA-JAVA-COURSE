# Longest Common Prefix

## Overview

The Longest Common Prefix (LCP) problem involves finding the longest prefix that is common to all strings in a given set. This is a common problem in various applications such as DNA sequence analysis, autocomplete systems, and data compression.

### Key Concepts

1. **Longest Common Prefix (LCP)**:
   - The LCP of a set of strings is the longest initial segment that is shared by all strings in the set.
   - For example, the LCP of "flower", "flow", and "flight" is "fl".

2. **Trie Structure**:
   - A Trie (prefix tree) is well-suited for efficiently finding the LCP among a set of strings.
   - Each node in the Trie represents a character, and paths from the root represent prefixes of the input strings.

3. **Trie for LCP**:
   - Insert all strings into the Trie.
   - Traverse the Trie from the root and collect characters as long as there is a single child at each node and all strings share this character.

4. **Applications**:
   - **Search Engines**: Autocomplete suggestions based on common prefixes.
   - **Genomics**: Finding common genetic sequences.
   - **Data Compression**: Identifying common prefixes for efficient encoding.

### Steps for Finding the Longest Common Prefix Using a Trie

1. **Insert Strings**:
   - Insert all strings into the Trie where each string is represented as a path of characters from the root to a leaf node.

2. **Traverse for LCP**:
   - Start from the root and follow the path as long as there is only one child and it is part of all input strings.

### Java Implementation Example: Longest Common Prefix Using a Trie

Here's a Java implementation example demonstrating how to build a Trie and find the longest common prefix among a set of strings:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class TrieLongestCommonPrefix {

    // Trie node class
    static class TrieNode {
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
        boolean isEndOfWord = false;
    }

    private TrieNode root;

    // Constructor to initialize the Trie
    public TrieLongestCommonPrefix() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    // Method to insert a string into the Trie
    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode currentNode = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            currentNode = currentNode.children.computeIfAbsent(ch, c -> new TrieNode());
        }
        currentNode.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    // Method to find the longest common prefix
    public String findLongestCommonPrefix() {
        StringBuilder lcp = new StringBuilder();
        TrieNode currentNode = root;
        
        while (currentNode != null) {
            if (currentNode.children.size() == 1 && !currentNode.isEndOfWord) {
                for (Map.Entry<Character, TrieNode> entry : currentNode.children.entrySet()) {
                    lcp.append(entry.getKey());
                    currentNode = entry.getValue();
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return lcp.toString();
    }

    // Main method to test Trie LCP operations
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrieLongestCommonPrefix trie = new TrieLongestCommonPrefix();
        String[] words = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
        
        for (String word : words) {
            trie.insert(word);
        }
        
        System.out.println("Longest Common Prefix: " + trie.findLongestCommonPrefix());
        // Output: "fl"
    }
}
